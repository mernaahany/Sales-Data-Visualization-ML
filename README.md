# Sales-Data-Visualization-ML
Sales data analysis and prediction using visualizations and machine learning models (SVR, Random Forest, XGBoost, KNN).  Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) and ML-based sales forecasting with multiple regression models.  Machine Learning project for sales prediction with data visualization and performance evaluation.

# Sales Data Visualization & Machine Learning ðŸ“ŠðŸ¤–

This repository contains a Colab notebook for **sales data analysis, visualization, and forecasting** using various machine learning models.  
The project aims to explore sales patterns through **EDA & visualizations** and build predictive models to forecast sales.
